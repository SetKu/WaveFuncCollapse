# Wave Function Collapse

A home-grown implementation of the [Wave Function Collapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse). It takes in a sample character map, analyzes it, and then attempts to find a valid solution based on it. The greater the detail provided in the sample text file, the more quickly the algorithm will find a solution, in general. The output map it creates can be varied in width and height. Additionally, transformations, i.e. rotations and reflections, to the image can be applied, optionally.
